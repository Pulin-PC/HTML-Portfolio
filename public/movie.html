<h2>Pulin's Top 3 movies:</h2>
<hr>
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>Best movie to remind yourself to not take life too seriously, and walk through hell with a smile.</p>
<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>
<p>Again, reminds you to live life to the fullest and enjoy the little time you have with your loved ones. Finish your bucket list before your last breath.</p>
<h3>Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani</h3>
<p>All my favourite movies keep reminding me ki bhai, jo bhi kr rha hai, kha pe bhi ho, maza looto. Duniya toh chalti rhegi, bakchodi nhi rukni chahiye. LOL</p>
